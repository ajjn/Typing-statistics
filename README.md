#Typing statistics
![Intro](/images/logo.png)

## What you'll get
There are two programs. keystats.py records key typing and calculated the statistics out of the experiment. typing_simulator.py is just to demonstrate how to simulate typing of a text with known statistics assuming that the logarithm of the typing interval is normally distributed.
## What is needed
To run this program you need Python 3.x with tkinter, numpy and matplotlib.
